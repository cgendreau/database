Database Cookbook
=================

This cookbook is a fork from the [official cookbook](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/database) but without dependency to the official Postgresql cookbook.
The goal is to use the database cookbook for MySQL but [another cookbook](https://github.com/phlipper/chef-postgresql) for Postgresql support.
